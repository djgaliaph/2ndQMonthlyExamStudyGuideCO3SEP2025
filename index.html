            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">1. The Role of a Router</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A <strong>router</strong> is a networking device that acts as a traffic director for data packets. Its primary function is to forward data between different computer networks, such as connecting your home network to the internet. Routers analyze the destination address of a data packet and use a <strong>routing table</strong> to determine the most efficient path for the data to reach its destination.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">2. Understanding "LAN"</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed"><strong>LAN</strong> stands for <strong>Local Area Network</strong>. It is a network that connects devices within a small, limited geographical area, like a home, school, or office building. A LAN allows connected devices to share resources, such as files, printers, and internet access.

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">3. Ethernet Cabling</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">The most common type of cable used for a wired Ethernet network is the <strong>twisted pair cable</strong>. This cable is made of insulated copper wires twisted together in pairs. The twisting helps to reduce <strong>electromagnetic interference (EMI)</strong> and <strong>crosstalk</strong>, ensuring a reliable data signal. Two common types are <strong>Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)</strong> and <strong>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)</strong>.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">4. What is a "MAN"?</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A <strong>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</strong> is a network that spans a larger area than a LAN but is smaller than a WAN (Wide Area Network). It is typically used to connect multiple LANs within a city or a large campus, providing high-speed connectivity across different buildings or locations.</p>

                <p class="leading-relaxed">Networks are categorized by their geographical scope:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small area like a building or campus.</li>
                    <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Covers a city or large campus.</li>
                    <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Spans a large geographical area, such as a country or the world (e.g., the internet).</li>
                    <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network):</strong> Covers a very small area, connecting a person's personal devices like a smartphone and a headset.</li>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">6. The Definition of a Computer Network</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A <strong>computer network</strong> is a system of interconnected computers and other devices that can share resources and information. These resources can include hardware (like printers) and software (like shared applications or files).</p>

            <!-- 7. The "NIC" -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">7. The "NIC"</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed"><strong>NIC</strong> stands for <strong>Network Interface Card</strong>. This is a hardware component that allows a computer to physically connect to a network. It provides the circuitry and port (usually an RJ45 port) required to transmit and receive data over a network cable.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">8. Wireless Access Point (WAP)</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A <strong>Wireless Access Point (WAP)</strong> is a device that provides wireless connectivity to a network. It connects to a wired network and creates a <strong>wireless local area network (WLAN)</strong>, allowing devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets to connect to the network using Wi-Fi signals.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">9. Routers and Large Networks</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">Routers are essential for large networks because they are responsible for directing data traffic between different networks. By using logical addresses (IP addresses), a router determines the most efficient path for a data packet to travel, ensuring it reaches its correct destination, even if it has to cross multiple networks.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">10. UTP Cable Construction</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A standard UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cable typically contains <strong>four</strong> pairs of twisted wires, for a total of eight individual wires. These pairs are color-coded to ensure correct wiring.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">11. The RJ45 Connector</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">The <strong>RJ45 connector</strong> is the standard connector used to terminate UTP cables and plug them into network devices. It securely attaches the cable's wires to the pins inside the connector, allowing for a proper connection to a network port.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">12. Coaxial Cable's Shield</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">A coaxial cable has a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer jacket. The purpose of the <strong>metallic shield</strong> is to protect the inner data-carrying wire from external <strong>electromagnetic interference (EMI)</strong> and radio frequency interference (RFI). This ensures a clean and reliable data signal.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">13. STP vs. UTP</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">The main difference between <strong>Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)</strong> and Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cables is the presence of a protective metallic shield in STP. This shield provides additional protection against electromagnetic interference, making STP a better choice in environments with a lot of electrical noise.</p>

                <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">14. Fiber Optic Transmission</h2>
                <p class="leading-relaxed">Fiber optic cables transmit data using pulses of light. This process is called <strong>optical transmission</strong>. The light pulses travel through a thin strand of glass or plastic fiber, allowing for very high-speed data transfer over long distances without signal degradation.</p>
